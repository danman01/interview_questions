## Pattern Recognition
The hard part of coding interviews is having that breakthrough "Aha!" moment.

The secret to those "Aha" moments? They always come from applying a simple algorithmic pattern.

What's an "algorithmic pattern"? They take on a few different forms. But there are only so many of them. 

Some examples:

- Go bottom-up instead of top-down.
- Cut the problem in half and solve each half.
- Use a stack.

Of course, pattern recognition happens naturally, in our subconscious. That's how learning works. But with deliberate effort, it happens way faster.

If you focus on patterns, you won't just learning answers—you will be learning _approaches_. And you will start covering a lot more ground.

So here's the tip: start collecting your own list of "patterns." Start a new doc on your computer or—even better—grab a fresh notebook. For every practice question you do, take a few minutes at the end to remember the moments where you got stuck. The things you had trouble figuring out. The things you got wrong at first. Basically, what approaches you learned, that you can apply to future questions.

You should have just a few of these per question—at least 1, and no more than 5.

After each practice session, review your whole list of patterns. Read it at the beginning of each practice session too. Heck, read it once real quick before bed. This'll add a nice layer of rigor to your practice, so you're really internalizing the lessons you're learning.

Why aren't I just giving you the patterns? It wouldn't be as effective. The patterns don't really make sense until you've put them in your own words by discovering them in the context of a real coding interview question. Trust me.
